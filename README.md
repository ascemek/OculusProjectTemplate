In order to implement OVRPlayerController, you do not need to write any script by yourself.

All of the objects and scripts that you need are a part of the Oculus Integration package.

I highly recommend making this OVRPlayerController a prefab (I alrady did it for you) so you can 
use it on your other scenes and projects without going over the same steps to implement them.

You can implement your own OVRPlayerController by adding the LocalAvatar prefab to OVRCameraRig.
